**Introduction to Shell Scripting in Linux**

Shell scripting is a powerful and fundamental aspect of Linux and Unix-like operating systems. 
It allows users and administrators to automate tasks, execute commands, and create customized solutions by writing scripts using shell programming languages like Bash, sh, etc.

At its core, a shell script is a text file containing a series of commands that can be executed in sequence. 
These scripts leverage the capabilities of the system's command-line interface, the shell, to perform a wide range of tasks, from simple file manipulation and text processing to complex system administration tasks.

**Shell scripting is a valuable skill for Linux users and administrators for several reasons:**

1. **Automation:** Shell scripts can automate repetitive tasks, making it easier to manage and maintain a Linux system.
   This includes tasks such as backups, log analysis, software installations, and user management.
   
2. **Customization:** Shell scripts allow users to create customized solutions tailored to their specific needs. You can build scripts to monitor server performance, deploy     
   applications, or set up development environments with just a few lines of code.

3. **Scripting Languages:** Linux provides access to various shell programming languages, such as Bash, which offer powerful features like loops, conditionals, functions, and the 
   ability to interact with system utilities and programs.

4. **Script Portability:** Shell scripts are highly portable. They can run on different Linux distributions and Unix-like systems with minor modifications, making them versatile tools 
   for system administrators and developers.

5. **Script Debugging:** Shell scripting provides tools for debugging and error handling, allowing you to identify and fix issues efficiently.

6. **Script Sharing:** The Linux community thrives on collaboration and sharing. Users often share their shell scripts and solutions with others, contributing to a rich ecosystem of 
   open-source tools.

In this realm of shell scripting, you can start with simple scripts and gradually build your skills to create more complex and sophisticated solutions. Whether you're a system administrator looking to automate routine tasks, a developer seeking to streamline your workflow, or just someone interested in learning more about Linux, shell scripting is a valuable skill to acquire. 

It empowers you to harness the full potential of the command line and make your Linux experience more efficient and productive.

**Let's write our first shell scripting:**

**Step 1:** On our terminal, open a folder called shell-scripting using the command *mkdir shell-scripting*. This will hold all the scripting we would write in this lesson.


**Step 2:** Create a file called user-input.sh using the command *touch user-input.sh*


**Step 3:** Inside copy and paste the block of code below: 


#!/bin/bash

# Prompt the user for their name
echo "Enter your name:"
read name

# Display a greeting with the entered name
echo "Hello, $name! Nice to meet you."

A little summary about the code block, the script will prompt for your name. when you input your name, it displays the text *hello! nice to meet you*

Also, the *#!/bin/bash* helps you specify the type of bash interpreter to be used to execute the script.

**Step 4:** Save your file

**Step 5:** Run the command *sudo chmod +x user-input.sh*

**Step 6:** Run the script using the command *./user-input.sh*
