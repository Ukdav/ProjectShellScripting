**Introduction to Shell Scripting in Linux**

Shell scripting is a powerful and fundamental aspect of Linux and Unix-like operating systems. 
It allows users and administrators to automate tasks, execute commands, and create customized solutions by writing scripts using shell programming languages like Bash, sh, and others.

At its core, a shell script is a text file containing a series of commands that can be executed in sequence. 
These scripts leverage the capabilities of the system's command-line interface, the shell, to perform a wide range of tasks, from simple file manipulation and text processing to complex system administration tasks.
